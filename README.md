Recent college graduate seeking learning experiences in digital marketing and strategic communications. I hold a bachelors degree in Marketing from DePaul University. While at DePaul I took numerous courses in marketing, management, and business development, held multiple positions and studied abroad; further developing my passion for international business, consumer research, and marketing analytics.

I thrive in creatively challenging and innovative environments. I plan to use my knowledge and experience to help businesses leverage their social media content and search tools to enhance their presence in the digital landscape.
